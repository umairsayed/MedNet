			<h2 id="content"> Our Motto </h2>
			<p>As Corona virus disease spreads across the world, healthcare community is preparing itself for the
				various challenges associated with it. We at MedNet have been streamlining and evolving our workflows
				for rapid diagnosis and clinical management, infection prevention, quality care and safety protocols.
				Because all of this matters not only to the COVID patients but also to our healthcare workers and other
				non COVID patients :</p>

					<h3>Staff Safety</h3>
					<p>If you feel unwell such as having fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
						If you are going to visit the hospital, you need to know the following</p>
				</div>
				<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
					<h3>Infection control</h3>
					<p>MedNet Infection control committee guides on processes on environmental cleaning, disinfection
						and cohorting patients. Waste management protocols are abided by at all times and are in line
						with the local regulations. Approved and Verified chemicals are put to use for stringent
						infection control. Personal protective equipment of standard quality is provided for our
						patients and staff.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
					<h3>Quality Systems</h3>
					<p>Stringent and standardized protocols are put into place by various stakeholders and staffs are
						trained to follow these. Surveillance measures are in place to check the compliance to these
						protocols.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
					<h3>Maintain Hygiene</h3>
					<p>You will be asked to cover your mouth with a mask. A cloth mask would also be good enough.
						Followed by this you will be asked to use the hand rub to sanitize your hands. Why? Washing your
						hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your
						hands.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
					<h3>Billing Services</h3>
					<p>We advise you to use digital payment methods as they are no-touch/ minimal touch transactions.
						Please follow the floor markings while standing in the billing queue.</p>
